States of drones : 

S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5. 


S0 (DRONE READY) --FLYING--> S1 (LOADING MISSION) -Recieved Mission-->

S2(NAVIGATING) --Found Target--> S3(DELIVERING PACKAGE) --package delivered-->

S4(NAVIGATING HOME) --preparing to land--> S5( LANDED.) --> EXIT


The drones have a route number, so at any point in this flight, if the numbers
match, the drones are going to cross paths. If this is the case, we will
detect it, and perform a "dodge", in order to ensure the drones chose a
different altitude or horizontal path to their target.
